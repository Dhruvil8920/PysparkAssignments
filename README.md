# Pyspark Assignment Repository

This repository contains a collection of Pyspark questions where you need to write logic for specific problems.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Pyspark Assignment Repository, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/Dhruvil8920/PysparkAssignments

### Step 2: Create a Branch

Create a branch with your name to work on the problems. This will help organize the changes made by different contributors. Use the following command to create a branch:

git checkout -b Assignment-your-name

Replace `your-name` with your actual name.

### Step 3: Solve the Problems

Solve the problems by writing logic for each specific question. The questions are provided within the repository.

You must write the logic of the function for the specific function in the `util.py` file located within. 

Create a driver file where the `util.py` file is called `driver.py` inside of each assignment, calling the functions from the `util.py` file to finish the questions for that assignment.

After that, you must create your own test cases in `test` directory to determine whether or not the function in the `util.py` file is operating correctly.

Once you have completed solving a problem, commit your changes to your branch.

### Step 4: Check Test Results

After committing your solutions, you can find your test results in the Teams channel dedicated to this repository. The test results will help you verify the correctness of your code and provide feedback on any errors or issues that may exist.

Please note that it may take some time for the test results to be generated and posted in the Teams channel.

Happy coding!
